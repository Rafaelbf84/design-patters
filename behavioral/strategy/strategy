Definition:

	Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. 
	Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Implementations:

	java.util.Comparator#compare(), executed by among others Collections#sort().
	javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet, the service() and all doXXX() methods take HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse and the implementor has to process them (and not to get hold of them as instance variables!).
	javax.servlet.Filter#doFilter()
